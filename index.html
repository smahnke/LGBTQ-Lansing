However, it opened its doors to the LGBTQ crowd in the 60s after they were turned away from the new Sir Club whose topless dancers catered only to straight men. Rudy Stober, a heterosexual immigrant and described by others as open and kind, opened his doors to provide a safe and welcoming atmosphere for patrons turned away from other private businesses. To cater to the disco crowd, he hired Flint gay club owner Bill Kane to update the decor for this purpose.<h3>Departure:</h3>the gay community at this bar eventually became victims of violent muggings. Often this would go unreported as the Lansing Police didn't support the gay community. The once safe Stober's no longer became an option.</p>")

The bar has been described as a 'neighborhood bar' wherein locals from nearby, mostly gay but also straight, would frequent.<h3>Departure:</h3>In its last year, Chrome Cat threw a 'save the Kitty' drive to pay the $13k of Donnell's back rent. Manager Melissa Kim was still faced with meager future options, and due to business taxes, decided to close Chrome Cat's doors. Kim tells Lansing City Pulse, 'You can't fight the government. They were going to negotiate but the whole support your local artists idea wasn't really working out for us.'</p>")
